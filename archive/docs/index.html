    <p> Welcome. </p>
    <p> This project researches ways to use technology to help people manage pain, so medical staff have alternatives to
opiates and consequently less people become newly addicted to their prescriptions. Opiate substitutes
must fulfill the essential functions of drugs to soothe, sedate, anesthetize, and relax. Technology could
match the desired emotional effect of drugs with virtual or augmented reality (VR/AR). The objective is
to engineer and validate pain mitigation strategies based on VR/AR that guides participants towards
calmer emotional states using biofeedback from wearable sensors. <br/> The broader impact of this work diversifies options
for pain management, which alleviates the pressure
on opiates as the workhorse solution and reduces the risk of chemical dependency. VR/AR immerses
participants in stimulus-rich worlds designed to overload cognitive function. Gaming or navigating
requires significant mental bandwidth for decision making, which has been shown to rate-limit the
processing of pain propagating from the body during a procedure or therapy. If the patient feels less pain,
then they are better able to comply with rehabilitation practices. Relaxing experiences could alleviate
agitation during infusion therapies like chemotherapy, dialysis, or sickle cell treatment. VR/AR could be a
new tool to solve problems in the hospital like boredom, education, and social isolation. If portable,
patients could bring distraction technology home for acute instances of pain. Technology carries its own
risks for addiction that must be carefully surveyed. The intellectual merit is an objective measure of
emotion collected using wearable sensors that generates VR/AR experiences designed to match the
emotional effect of drugs. The biofeedback builds an archive of data useful for studying the energy
generation and dissipation in the central nervous system. This information can be used to build better
tissue engineering tools for researchers that model neural circuits. </p>
